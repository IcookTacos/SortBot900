## SortBot900
![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/5lj1637.png "Title")

A application to visualize sorting algorithms, written in Java. Made during my algorithm and datastructure studies in university. The goal was to have a generic frontend / backend architecture where the backend would hold a collection of different sorting algorithms and the frontend would be able to visualize the sorting. I guess my intressted died of after the first one since I only implemented a insertion sort in the backend.

## Usage
-build
opens the array builder, lets you input numbers from -1 to 10 and create an array of size 10

-e
enters the built array to the bot so it can be sorted

-sort
sorts the currently built array with insertion sort

-view
shows the array with representation of graphs with staples
