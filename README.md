## Current algoritms ##
 - Insertion sort

## TODO ## 
Feel pretty much finished with the project so far. Could add more sorting algorithms and expand for larger array sizes since the 
10 size array with range from 0 to 10 is pretty trivial. Could clean up the code *alot* since it's very ugly.


## COMMANDS ##
- build
opens the array builder, lets you input numbers from -1 to 10 and create an array of size 10

-e
enters the built array to the bot so it can be sorted

-sort
sorts the currently built array with insertion sort

-view
shows the array with representation of graphs with staples
